# Advance Perception in Autonomous Vehicles

The proposed system gives the Autonomous vehicle the ability to sense the road in which it also keeps track of the lane in which it is driving ,all by using computer vision as a source of perception. The three-dimensional occupancy of other cars and bicycles on the road can be obtained using OpenCV only through camera frame systems with speed estimation.

Install all dependencies
```
python install -r requirement.txt
```

To run code 
```
python main.py
```

For lane segmentation make the flag true.
